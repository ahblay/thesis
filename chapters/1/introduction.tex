\chapter{Introduction}

We shall begin this thesis with a puzzle. Consider the lattice depicted in the leftmost diagram of figure \ref{fig:simple_puzzle}. We refer to the elements of this lattice as \emph{cells}. Suppose we have the capacity to infect some cells (colored red) with a disease, and that this disease will, over a period of time, propagate through uninfected cells of the lattice. Let uninfected cells become infected if they are exposed to at least two infected neighboring cells in the vertical and/or horizontal directions. We say that the initial infection is \emph{lethal} if the entire lattice ultimately becomes infected. Here is the puzzle:

\begin{question}
\label{que:simple_puzzle}
What is the fewest number of infected cells necessary to spawn a lethal infection?
\end{question}

\begin{figure}[]

\caption{An arbitrary set of initially infected cells in the $10 \times 10$ lattice, and the stages of infection.}
\label{fig:simple_puzzle}
\end{figure} 

Before we present the solution (which is particularly elegant and satisfying, and the reader is encouraged to play around with this problem on their own and get a feel for the behavior), let us take a moment to examine some properties of infectious sets and attempt to characterize what attributes might correspond to lethality. It should not take too long to observe that if an initial infection is in some way ``spread too thin," it will be unable to jump between infected areas, leading to gaps in infection, which we refer to as \emph{immune regions}. The perimeter of the lattice is particularly susceptible to this, as vertices there have fewer neighbors from whom they might be exposed. Heuristically, then, a lethal set must have the ability to effectively span the entire lattice, and must be particularly virulent along the perimeter. 

At this point, we are able to make some educated guesses regarding the specific structure of sets that are likely to be lethal. In particular, we would like to consider the two starting infections illustrated in figure \ref{fig:two_infections}. Notice that while figure \ref{fig:two_infections} (\subref{fig:two_infections_b}) has far fewer perimeter infections, both (\subref{fig:two_infections_a}) and (\subref{fig:two_infections_b}) manage to form continuous bands of infected cells that appear to span the entire lattice after one step. Indeed, this holds with our notion of immune regions (or lack thereof), and we see that both infections will continue to propagate outwards from these bands until all cells become infected.

\caption{Two lethal sets and their resulting infections after one time-step.}

\end{figure} 

It is clear from figure \ref{fig:two_infections} that we may obtain lethal sets on the $n \times n$ lattice of size $n$ by simply infecting the diagonal. What is less obvious is whether it is possible to improve upon this result. Perhaps the most natural first attempt at this is to remove an infection from one of the cells along the diagonal. However, this seems to form an immune region around the removed cell. After some experimentation, one begins to believe it impossible to simultaneously satisfy the heuristic that a starting infection must span the lattice, while also using fewer than $n$ initial infections. The question therefore becomes: how do we prove it?

\section{Formalizing these observations}

Before presenting a proof, let us take a moment to formally define the process described above and develop some useful notation. The study of such cellular infection spread in grids (and more generally in graphs) is known in the literature as \emph{bootstrap percolation}, and was introduced in the 1970s by Chalupa et al. \cite{chalupa:1979} as a simplified model for the behavior of ferromagnetic fields. In their original 1979 paper, the authors research the stable structure of probabilistically selected initial infections. While this differs from the problem posed in question \ref{que:simple_puzzle}, the rules for the spread of infection and its broad behavior remain the same. It is worth noting that a large portion of contemporary research on bootstrap problems is focused on questions of probabilistic nature; while these problems are certainly of merit and quite interesting, they do not fall within the scope of this thesis. Rather, we shall focus on those problems where we have specific control over the structure of the initial infections; in particular, we aim to determine the smallest lethal set on a variety of graph classes. 

Let us define our problem in concrete terms. Let $G$ be a graph and $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$ be a set of initially infected vertices. Iteratively, we infect those vertices of $G$ with at least $r$ infected neighbors. For all $t > 0$, let $A_t$ be the set of infected vertices at time step $t$. We then have
$$A_t = A_{t-1} \cup \{v \in V(G) : |N_G(v) \cap A_{t-1}| \geq r\},$$
where $N_G(v)$ is the set of vertices adjacent to $v$ in $G$. We define the \emph{closure} of $A_0$ under $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation to be $[A_0] = \bigcup_{t=0}^{\infty} A_t$. We say that $A_0$ \emph{percolates} or is \emph{lethal} if $[A_0] = V(G)$. We define the smallest percolating set on a graph $G$ under $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation by the quantity $m(r,G)$. We note that under these rules, it is not possible for vertices to become uninfected.

In the context of question \ref{que:simple_puzzle}, $G = P_{10} \Osq P_{10}$, and our diagonal construction shows us that $m(2,G) \leq 10$. In general, we have observed that for $G = P_n \Osq P_n$, $m(2, G) \leq n$. Now, let us prove that the bound is, in fact, tight. 

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:tight_perimeter}
For all $n \geq 1$, 
$$m([n]^2, 2) = n.$$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The upper bound follows from our diagonal construction in figure \ref{fig:two_infections} (\subref{fig:two_infections_b}). The lower bound is given by the famous ``perimeter argument". Consider the $n\times n$ grid $G$, given by $G = P_n \Osq P_n$. Let $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$ be a set of initially infected cells. We claim that the total perimeter of all infected regions in $G$ is monotonically decreasing as a function of the time-step $t$. Consider an arbitrary healthy cell $c$. In order for $c$ to become infected, at least two of its edges must abut infected cells. However, this implies that (upon infection of $c$) these edges are absorbed within the newly expanded infected region, thereby reducing the perimeter of infection by two. As $c$ contains at most two un-absorbed edges, the perimeter of infection cannot increase. 

Since a lethal set will infect the entire grid, and therefore have a final perimeter of infection of $4n$, it follows that the perimeter of infection of $A_0$ must be at least $4n$, and so $m([n]^2, 2) \geq n.$
\end{proof}

This proof appears in \cite{przykucki:2019}, although it has been an established result in bootstrap percolation ``folklore" for considerably longer. We should like to make a few additional observations. 

First, note that we have used the following three expressions to describe the same graph $G$:

\begin{center}
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*),itemjoin={\qquad}]
\item $n \times n$
\item $P_n \Osq P_n$
\item $[n]^2.$
\end{enumerate*}
\end{center}
\vspace{0.2in}

\noindent The notation in (i) is useful when discussing the shape of low dimensional, asymmetric grids. We use the notation in (ii) to remind readers that the fundamental structure in bootstrap percolation problems is a graph, and to suggest possible extensions of the problem discussed in this thesis to other similar objects. The notation in (iii) is the standard way to describe the vertex set of a grid graph, and can readily be generalized to any dimension $d$ by writing $[n]^d$. In a slight abuse of notation, we use $[n]^d$ to represent the entire graph $G$, and draw edges between vertices that differ by exactly one in exactly one coordinate. 

Second, the fact that we have used the notation $[n]^2$ in Proposition \ref{prop:tight_perimeter} suggests that we can generalize to higher dimensional grids $[n]^d$. Indeed, simply observe that for a given hypercube cell to become infected, it must donate at least $d$ of its $2d$ hyperplane faces to the infected region, thereby at most maintaining the current $(d-1)$-perimeter of infection. The following theorem summarizes this result, which we refer to informally as the \emph{surface area bound} or \emph{S.A. bound}.  

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:tight_perimeter}
For all $n,d \geq 1$, 
$$m([n]^d, d) = n^{d-1}.$$

The problem of bootstrap percolation was first introduced in the 1970s by Chalupa et al. \cite{chalupa:1979} as a simplified model for the behavior of ferromagnetic fields. In their original paper, the authors describe bootstrap percolation as the stabilization of a probabilistically occupied lattice, where each occupied site must be adjacent to at least $m$ occupied neighbors. A re-rendering of the examples given in the original 1979 paper is presented in figures 1 and 2. 

In this original problem, the authors are interested in the structural patterns of these stable arrangements. Put differently, given a set of randomly distributed occupants on a $d$-dimensional lattice, what configuration can we expect these occupied sites to fall into, subject to the constraint that each occupied site is adjacent to at least $m$ other occupants? In this construction, a probabilistically populated lattice is iteratively de-populated until it reaches a stable state. 

Alternatively, we might consider the behavior of a population as it grows, instead of shrinks. In this model, it is useful to consider the population as harboring an infection that steadily spreads from site to site, subject to population density. We shall consider these infections to take place on a graph, with vertices representing members of our population (sites), and edges indicating adjacency. In formal terms: let $G$ be a graph and $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$ be a set of initially infected vertices. Iteratively, at every time step, infect those vertices of $G$ with at least $r$ infected neighbors. For all $t > 0$, let $A_t$ be the set of infected vertices at time step $t$. We then have
$$A_t = A_{t-1} \cup \{v \in V(G) : |N_G(v) \cap A_{t-1} \geq r\},$$
where $N_G(v)$ is the set of vertices adjacent to $v$ in $G$. We define the \emph{closure} of $A_0$ under $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation to be $[A_0] = \bigcup_{t=0}^{\infty} A_t$. This is analogous to the stable states introduced in \cite{chalupa:1979}. We say that $A_0$ \emph{percolates} or is \emph{lethal} if $[A_0] = V(G)$. We note that under these rules, it is not possible for vertices to become uninfected. 

Perhaps the most natural extremal question regarding $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation is that of determining the size of the smallest percolating set $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$, for a given graph $G$. We represent this quantity by $m(G,r)$. There has been a great deal of work done on establishing the value of $m(G,r)$ for various classes of graphs and values of $r$ (see \{citations, citations, etc., etc.\}). These results are incompletely summarized in table \ref{tab:known_bounds}, and a selection of particularly noteworthy proofs are presented in detail in the following section.

We end this introduction with the presentation of a delightful question about the cardinality of $2$-neighbor percolating sets on the two-dimensional lattice. The interested reader in encouraged to find a solution on their own; however, a proof of the result is presented at the beginning of the following section.
\begin{question}
Let $(n,n)$ represent the $n \times n$ lattice, given by $G = P_n \times P_n$. What is $m(n,n,2)$?
\end{question}

\section{Minimum percolating sets and bounds}

\subsection{Foundations}

Let us build some intuition for the behavior of percolating sets on the two-dimensional lattice. Figure \ref{fig:5x5x1} illustrates the percolation time-steps for an arbitrary initial infection on the graph $G=P_5 \times P_5$, where $r=2$. (In general, we shall refer to the $d$-dimensional lattice with sides $a_1, \dots, a_d$ as the $d$-tuple $(a_1, \dots, a_d)$. The standard notation is $\prod_{i=1}^d a_i$.) 

\begin{figure}[]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/1/5x5x1.pdf}
\caption{Percolation time-steps for an arbitrary initial infection on the $5 \times 5$ lattice, $r=2$.}
\label{fig:5x5x1}
\end{figure} 

Note that this configuration fails to infect the entire grid; that is, the initial infection is not lethal. Heuristically, this appears to be a consequence of the fact that infected cells are unable to access the healthy cells in the rightmost column. We might, therefore, hypothesize that an initial infection must somehow ``span" the entire lattice. A potential ``spanning" construction is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:5x5x1_improved}. Observe that at each time-step, the infection spreads out laterally from the initial diagonal. It is a simple exercise to verify that this construction is lethal on all $(n,n)$ grids for $r=2$. We also note that a similar construction is lethal on all $(n,m)$ grids for $r=2$ (figure \ref{fig:8x4x1}).

\begin{figure}[]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/1/5x5x1_improved.pdf}

\end{figure}

\caption{A lethal infection on the $8 \times 4$ lattice, $r=2$.}
\label{fig:8x4x1}
\end{figure} 

The $(n,n)$ construction can be generalized to any dimension. Specifically, we have:

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:nxn_lower_bound}
For all $n,d \geq 1$, 
$$m([n]^d, d) \leq n^{d-1}.$$
\end{prop}
This result has been known since at least Pete \cite{pete:1997}, although the particular constructions are difficult to render in general. The following proof (appearing in \cite{przykucki:2019}, but known in bootstrap percolation ``folklore" for much longer) elegantly shows that this bound is tight.

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:tight_perimeter}
For all $n,d \geq 1$, 
$$m([n]^d, d) = n^{d-1}.$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The upper bound follows from proposition \ref{prop:nxn_lower_bound}. The lower bound is given by a generalization of the famous ``perimeter argument". Suppose $d=2$ and consider an embedding of $G=[n]^d$ in the $n\times n$ grid. Let $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$ be a set of initially infected cells. We claim that the total perimeter of all infected regions in $G$ is monotonically decreasing as a function of the time-step $t$. Consider an arbitrary healthy cell $c$. In order for $c$ to become infected, at least two of its edges must abut infected cells. However, this implies that (upon infection of $c$) these edges are absorbed within the newly expanded infected region, thereby reducing the perimeter of infection by two. As $c$ contains at most two un-absorbed edges, the perimeter of infection cannot increase. 

Since a lethal set will infect the entire grid, and therefore have a final perimeter of infection of $4n$, it follows that the perimeter of infection of $A_0$ must be at least $4n$, and so $m([n]^2, 2) \geq n.$

The same argument generalizes nicely to higher dimensions. Simply observe that for a given hypercube cell to become infected, it must donate at least $d$ of its $2d$ hyperplane faces to the infected region, thereby at most maintaining the current $(d-1)$-perimeter of infection.
\end{proof}

We note that the perimeter argument extends directly to rectangular grids; however, the problem of obtaining tight constructions, should they exist, is largely unsolved and will be the main focus of this thesis. The following proposition, which we refer to informally as the \emph{surface area bound} or \emph{S.A. bound}, provides a lower bound on the size of lethal sets for $d$-dimensional rectangular grids where $r=d$.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:SA_bound}
For $d \geq 1$ and $a_1, \dots, a_d \geq 1$,
$$m(a_1, \dots, a_d, d) \leq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^d \prod_{j \neq i} a_j}{d}.$$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Observe that the expression
$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^d \prod_{j \neq i} a_j}{d}$$
is precisely the high-dimensional perimeter of the grid graph $(a_1, \dots, a_d)$. The bound follows from the perimeter argument in theorem \ref{thm:tight_perimeter}. 
\end{proof}

In \{some chapter of this thesis\}, we will prove that this bound is tight in the case where $d=3$ and $d_1,d_2,d_3 \geq 8$. We fully expect that this bound can be incrementally diminished; however, we feel that such small improvements do not at this time justify the effort required to obtain additional constructions. 

In the remainder of this section, we shall present a number of additional bootstrap percolation results for different classes of grid graphs.

\subsection{Additional results}

Recall from the previous section that $m(n,n,2) = n$, where the tight construction for the lower bound is given by a diagonal infection expanding laterally outwards. In a paper by Balogh and Bollobas \cite{balogh:2006}, this result is generalized to all $d$-dimensional hypercubes $(a_1, \dots, a_d)$, $a_i \geq 1$. 

\begin{thm}
For $d \geq 1$ and $a_1, \dots, a_d \geq 1$, 
$$m(a_1, \dots, a_d, 2) = \ceil*{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^d (a_i-1)}{2}}+1.$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

As suggested by table \ref{tab:known_bounds}, general results become quite sparse for $r \notin \{2,d\}$. A nice result from Morrison and Noel resolves the question of $r=3$ for hypercubes $P_2^d$ of dimension $d \geq 3$. 

\begin{thm}
For $d \geq 3$ and $a_1 = \dots = a_d = 2$, 
$$m(a_1, \dots, a_d, 3) = \ceil*{\frac{d(d+3)}{6}}.$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

However, the issue of determining $m(a_1, \dots, a_d, r)$ is largely unresolved. Furthermore, good lower bounds for $r \neq d$ are conspicuously absent.
