\documentclass[12pt,oneside]{sigmasthesis}

% The goal is to update Ross's template and make it helpful for all SIGMAS members.
% This template uses an updated version of Ross's uvicthesis document class, now called sigmasthesis.
% Place the class file in the same folder as the document file.

% Original template by Ross Churchley, circa 2011 or so
% Updated by Joseph Horan, Spring 2020

% Use 12pt font (people will thank you for not using a smaller font).
% The oneside option is passed to the underlying book class; it horizontally centers the pages, instead of forcing a book-style page turn. Page-numbering is adjusted to be symmetric in the class.

%								THEOREM ENVIRONMENTS
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

% Again, feel free to replace these with whatever is best for you! Look at the amsthm package documentation for more info.

% Tips for theorem numbering: While it's up to you, you might wish to try a system that makes it easiest to find results, and if two systems are equally easy to use, then use the simpler of the two. Generally you will have chapters or sections in your document, so numbering at least 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, ... might be good; if you also have subsections, maybe you could do 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2,2, etc, together with numbered subsections. You might also do unnumbered subsections and use only section numbering, if the subsections tend to be short.

% These environments are theorem-like; they have bold labels and italicized text. 

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[chapter] % Numbering is impacted by [chapter]; could do [section] or [subsection] also.
\newtheorem{lem}[thm]{Lemma} % The [thm] argument says to number Lemma in sequence with Theorem.
\newtheorem{prop}[thm]{Proposition}
\newtheorem{cor}[thm]{Corollary}
\newtheorem{con}[thm]{Construction}
\newtheorem{conj}[thm]{Conjecture}
\newtheorem{prob}[thm]{Problem}

% These environments are unnumbered and will not count toward the numbering.

\newtheorem*{question}{Question}
\newtheorem*{answer}{Answer}
\newtheorem*{conjecture}{Conjecture}

% These environments are definitions; they have a different style (bold label, standard font).

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{defn}[thm]{Definition} % These definitions are also numbered in sequence with Theorem.
\newtheorem{eg}[thm]{Example}
\newtheorem{rem}[thm]{Remark}

\begin{abstract}
% Here is where the abstract goes; it gets typeset on its own page. No required length, but recommended ~250 words.
Consider infecting a subset $A_0 \subseteq V(G)$ of the vertices of a graph $G$. Let an uninfected vertex $v \in V(G)$ become infected if $|N_G(v) \cap A_0| \geq r$, for some integer $r$. Define $A_t = A_{t-1} \cup \{v \in V(G) : |N_G(v) \cap A_{t-1}| \geq r \},$ and say that the set $A_0$ is \emph{lethal} under $r$-neighbor percolation if there exists a $t$ such that $A_t = V(G)$. For a graph $G$, let $m(G,r)$ be the size of the smallest lethal set in $G$ under $r$-neighbor percolation. 

The problem of determining $m(G,r)$ has been extensively studied for grids $G$ of various dimensions. We define 
$$m\left (\prod_{i=1}^d [a_i], r\right ) = m(a_1, \dots, a_d, r)$$
for ease of notation. Famously, a lower bound of $m(a_1, \dots, a_d, d) \geq \frac{\sum_{j=1}^d \prod_{i \neq j} a_i}{d}$ is given by a beautiful argument regarding the high-dimensional ``surface area" of $G = [a_1] \times \dots \times [a_d]$. While exact values of $m(G,r)$ are known in some specific cases, general results are difficult to come by.

In this thesis, we introduce a novel technique for viewing $d$-neighbor lethal sets on $d$-dimensional grids in terms of lethal sets in $(d-1)$ dimensions. We also provide a strategy for recursively building up large lethal sets from existing small constructions. Using these techniques, we determine the exact size of all lethal sets under 3-neighbor percolation in three-dimensional grids $[a_1] \times [a_2] \times [a_3]$, for $a_1,a_2,a_3 \geq 11$. 

The problem of determining $m([n] \times [n],3)$ is discussed by Benevides, Bermond, Lesfari and Nisse in \cite{benevides:2021}. The authors determine the exact value of $m([n] \times [n],3)$ for even $n$, and show that, for odd $n$,
$$\ceil*{\frac{n^2+2n}{3}} \leq m([n] \times [n],3) \leq \ceil*{\frac{n^2+2n}{3}} + 1.$$
We prove that $m([n] \times [n],3) = \ceil*{\frac{n^2+2n}{3}}$ if and only if $n = 2^k-1$, for some $k >0$.

Finally, we prove that for $a_1,a_2,a_3 \geq 12$, bounds on the minimum lethal set on the the torus $G = C_{a_1} \square C_{a_2} \square C_{a_3}$ are given by
$$m(G,3) \ge \frac{a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 -2(a_1+a_2+a_3)}{3} +2$$
and
$$m(G,3) \le \frac{a_1a_2 + a_2a_3 + a_3a_1 -2(a_1+a_2+a_3)}{3} +3.$$

I would like to thank Dr. Peter Dukes and Dr. Jonathan Noel for their help and support with, and ongoing interest in, the research that has gone into producing this thesis. It has been both fun and exciting to explore the intricacies of this problem, and toy around with different methods for communicating our results. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge your flexibility regarding the difficulties brought on by COVID-19, and my frequent departures from Victoria throughout the duration of my master's. 

Of course, I would like to thank my parents, Sallie and Chip, for their ongoing encouragement and support, even when it means entertaining some arcane question about a particular configuration of dots on a grid. (Dots-and-boxes in undergrad, bootstrap percolation in grad school; it always comes back to dots, huh? Weird.) 

I'd like to thank my partner, Athena, for tolerating my frequent departures to Victoria, joining me on some pretty sweet road trips, and making me dinner when I'm desperately cramming to meet a deadline.

I'd like to thank my van, for achieving 90\% of the things a normal car can, and 60\% of what a house can. (And, I'd like to thank the David Turpin Building for filling in where the van missed.) 

Finally, I'd like to thank my friends for their generosity, their kindness, and for being fun.
